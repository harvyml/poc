## POC music App!

This is app was made using the deezer developer api, the app consists of the two main views, **home** and **favorite**.
The app was made using just React and localStorage for the data management as the app did not require a backend enviroment.

The app was initialized with create-react-app and has a simple hamburger structure where the *Layout* component comes in, you will see that the *views* components are always wrapped between the *Layout* component.

The app also uses *react-query* only on the pages where a fetch is done just once.

The app uses a library for the pagination system, if you scroll down to the bottom of the screen the next 20 elements will be loaded.

You can also search for songs with the search input located in *Home*.
